  <description>Adds saddle graphics to mountable vanilla animals.
	
&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;

This is an add-on mod for the Giddy-Up! mod that adds visual saddles to any mounts used by either the player or its enemies. These saddles are just eye candy, and don't affect any stats of the mounts.

Note that Giddy-Up! Core is listed as a dependancy, but you will also need one of the Giddy-Up! modules at least, sionce the core on its own doesn't do anything :) The screenshots for example use Giddy-Up! Battle Mounts

&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;

Some minor graphical glitches should be expected, such as saddles sometimes appearing over other saddles, but aside from that, nothing!

&lt;size=24&gt;Load Order&lt;/size&gt;

Always load after Giddy-Up! Core and any other Giddy-Up! modules you are using
