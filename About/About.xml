	<description>Adds saddle graphics to mountable vanilla animals.
		
		&lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
		
		This is an add-on mod for the Giddy-Up! mod that adds visual saddles to any mounts used by either the player or its enemies. These saddles are just eye candy, and don't affect any stats of the mounts.
		
		&lt;size=24&gt;Issues&lt;/size&gt;
		
		Some minor graphical glitches should be expected, such as saddles sometimes appearing over other saddles, but aside from that, nothing!
		
		&lt;size=24&gt;Load Order&lt;/size&gt;
		
		Always load after Giddy-Up! Core and any other Giddy-Up! modules you are using
		
		&lt;size=24&gt;Credit&lt;/size&gt;
		
		Credit goes to Roolo for his amazing work on Giddy-Up!
